The number of days users drove each month is almost uniform, and it largely correlates with the number of days they opened the app that month, except the driving_days distribution tails off on the right.However, there were almost twice as many users (~1,000 vs. ~550) who did not drive at all during the month. This might seem counterintuitive when considered together with the information from activity_days.\n",
    "4. According to the data analyzed, the churn rate for the dataset is 17.7%. This means that approximately 17.7% of the users stopped using or uninstalling the Waze app. Conversely, 82.3% of the users remained active, indicating that they continued to use the app.\n",
    "5. Frequent use of the Waze app was associated with lower churn rates, suggesting that satisfied users are less likely to stop using the app. Long-distance drivers were more likely to churn from the app, possibly due to dissatisfaction with the service or lack of need for the app. The number of drives made within a session was positively correlated with user retention, meaning users who make more drives within a session are less likely to leave the app. Users who use the app less frequently were more likely to churn, indicating that regular use may contribute to user retention. Professional drivers, who initiate more than 60 drives per month, churned at a much lower rate than average users, suggesting that these users are more committed to using the app.\n",
    "6. Long-term users (those who have been using the app for over a year) make up approximately 89.77% of the total user base, while newer users (those who have been using the app for less than a year) make up approximately 10.23%. This means that users with longer tenure have significantly greater representation in this dataset."
